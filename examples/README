This directory contains the L10 code examples from Simmons, Toninho, and
Pfenning's "Distributed deductive databases, declaratively: The L10 logic 
programming language," at the 2011 X10 workshop. 


Edge/Path example
=================
EdgePath1.l10
  -- Edge and path example in section 1.1

Program analysis example
========================
ProgAnalysisA.l10
  -- Figure 1: Program analysis: capturing program information.         
ProgAnalysisB.l10
  -- Liveness analysis in section 1.2/1.3
ProgAnalysisC.l10
  -- Interference analysis (cut due to space, uses liveness)
ProgAnalysisD.l10
  -- Figure 2. Program analysis: neededness.
ProgAnalysisE.l10
  -- Figure 3. Program analysis: dead code. 


Regular expression example
==========================
Regexp.l10
  -- Figure 4. Regular expression matching.
RegexpQuery.l10
  -- Querying the program defined in Figure 4 (discussed in 2.2.1)
RegexpNot.l10
  -- Figure 5. Regular expressions with negation.
RegexpNot2.l10
  -- More on regular expressions with negation. The example in the paper
     does not have the behavior expected on first glance, because 
     ¬(b|c) matches "ba", and therefore ¬(b|c)(a+) matches "baa".
